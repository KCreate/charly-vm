// Should contain a runtime check to make sure the unpacked value is an array

// Should contain a runtime check to make sure the unpacked value is an object

//
// Iterating over this range would yield the values 1 to 10
1..10

// Exclusive range
//
// Iterating over this range would yield the values 1 to 9
