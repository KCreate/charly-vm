// Implementation:  The runtime Function struct gets a new flag which
//                  stores if the function's last argument has a spread-operator
//                  If yes, the VM will pack all the correct arguments into
//                  an array and pass that as the last parameter.
//
//                  This needs to be implemented inside the VM::call_function
//                  method and should not require any changes to the code generation
//                  facilities.
//
//                  The previous 'arguments' identifier gets removed
//                  This means the instructions readarrayindex and setarrayindex can
//                  also be removed

// The '...' spread operator can be used to access all remaining arguments
func h(a, b, c...) = _

// The argument followed by the spread operator has to be
// the last argument of the function
//
//                 +- Can't have an argument after
//                 |  a argument spread operator
//                 |
//                 v
func j(a, b, c..., d) = _

// The following function declaration effectively renames the
// 'argument' identifier.
func k(a...) = _

// Arguments before can have default arguments
//
// l()            => [100, []]
// l(1)           => [1, []]
// l(1, 2)        => [1, [2]]
// l(1, 2, 3)     => [1, [2, 3]]
func l(num = 100, other...) = [num, other]
