// Implementation:  Default arguments need to be implemented inside
//                  the code-generation layer of the compiler. The
//                  VM itself doesn't actually have to know about this
//                  whole thing.
//
//                  A check inside the function argument parsing code
//                  looks out for '=' signs, skips them and parses an expression.
//                  It also sets a flag, to let subsequent passes know that
//                  the remaining arguments need to have default arguments too.
//
//                  The function node gets an additional parameter which
//                  denotes the minimum required argument count. This
//                  is the value which gets used by the VM to check if enough
//                  arguments have been passed to the function.

// Default arguments can be set by appending an identifier with an
// '=' sign and an expression. The expression is executed as soon
// as the function is getting called. It is effectively compiled to
// the following pseudo-code:
//
//    // Original code
//    func f(a, b = 1, c = 2) = a + b + c
//
//    // De-sugared pseudo-code
//    func f(a, b, c) {
//      if arguments.length < 1 b = 1
//      if arguments.length < 2 c = 2
//
//      // <block>
//    }
func f(a, b, c = 1) = (a + b) * c

// After a default value has been defined,
// all following arguments need default values too
//
//               +- Missing default argument for 'c'
//               |
//               v
func g(a, b = 1, c) = a + b + c
