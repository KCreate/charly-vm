A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping

A -> 1
B -> 2
...
Z -> 26

Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:

Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
Example 2:

Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

*/

  if str.length == 0 return 1
  if str[0] == "0" return 0

  if str.length == 1 {
    decoded_strings[str] = 1
