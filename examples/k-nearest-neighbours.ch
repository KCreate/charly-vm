//    Steps                       Time complexity
//
// 1. Compute Distances           O(N)
// 2. Store each into heap        O(N log K)
// 3. Pop each element            O(K log K)
//
// Depending on wether you want to count the removal of each element for printing
// as part of the algorithm the time complexity is either
//
// With:      O((N + K) log K)
// Without:   O(N log K)
//
// The first O(N) term is dropped, as the second one dominates it
