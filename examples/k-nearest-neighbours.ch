// Time complexity analysis

//    Steps                       Time complexity
//
// 1. Compute Distances           O(N)
// 2. Store each into heap        O(N log N)
// 3. Pop K elements from heap    O(K log N)
//
// Result: O(N + (N+K) log N)
//
// Optimisations:
//
// Using a max heap of max-size K would reduce
// the time complexity further down:

// 1. Compute Distances           O(N)

// 3. Print heap                  O(K)

// The term from step #3 has been dropped as it is as a constant
